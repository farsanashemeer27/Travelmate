Project Description:
Travel Mate is a modular travel companion web application that helps users plan trips, calculate budgets, check destination safety, and assess their travel readiness—all in a single platform. Users can customize trips for Kerala districts based on preferences and get dynamic travel suggestions.

Planning a trip can be confusing and stressful, especially when trying to manage:
Budget constraints
